# CovidCertificationAnalyzer
Just a demo project that I've done during my free time to analyze the Covid Certification 


# How it Works

Install the dependecies listed in the requirements.txt and then python starter.py.

Navigate to localhost:8072, choose your Green Pass image (can even be an image from the real world) and that's it! 

Your Green Pass will be analyzed and determined whether it's valid or not

# Disclaimer

This project was done just for fun purposes and it's not something that should replace your local government's application for scanning the Covid Certification.
This project doesn't gather ANY of your personal data that's coming from the Green Pass, as can be seen from the source code
